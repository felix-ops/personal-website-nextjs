			"As a Ground Station Engineer at Space Kidz India, I am responsible for developing a microcontroller and IoT-based satellite tracking and signal-capturing system that can be integrated with any YAGI or Dish antenna. The implemented system enables the antennas to autonomously track any LEO objects using its TLE data, while also capturing UHF satellite transmissions and relaying them to a host server while ensuring seamless satellite communication.",
